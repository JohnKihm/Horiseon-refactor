# <Horiseon-Accessibility>

## Description
The purpose of the site is to inform users of how to optimize their platform for search engines but due to functional errors and missing features it failed to be accessible to all users. I remedied this by adding alt text to images and fixing the navigation links in the site. I also simplified redundant code. My changes made the site more accessible to visually impaired users as well as improving site functionality. In doing these improvements I learned small changes can make a big difference in the code which can impair site functionality and accessibility.
